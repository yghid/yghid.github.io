        <p class="lead mb-4"> I was a link leader in the year of August 2021 in my junior year, I helped out the freshmen, gave them a campus tour, and also I volunteered to help out all graders during a make-up registration day. Did some community service in RISE, helped to volunteer during graduations, helped out with decorations and assistance. I did 5 hours of community service in RISE on June 2, 2022. I was a president of the LACE club, a language and culture exchange club that focuses on learning about different cultures, experiences, and activities while creating a space that celebrates those different cultures, cultural traditions, and holidays. I was a member of the LACE (Language and Culture Exchange) club in my freshman year of high school. In my junior year of high school, I became the president of the L.A.C.E club. In my junior year of high school, I was nominated by one of my teachers to be a GreenDot ambassador. Greendot is an organization that trains students to step up during bullying, sexual harassment, abuse, etc. The training included sharing peoples' experiences, how to help others who experience bullying and sexual harassment, and solutions to these types of situations. During my training in Greendot, I learned how bullying, harassment, and discrimination can present themselves, and solutions to these types. IÂ´ve also gained skills that gave me the confidence to speak up for myself and others. I have been a member of RISE since my freshman year of high school. It is an academic program for At-promise youth, which provides students with academic advising, mentorship, tutoring after school, and college preparedness activities. I was also a member of  National Society of Black Engineers - joined NSBE in my sophomore year of high school, I joined NSBE in my sophomore year of high school and i got to know about the program through one of my counselor advisor, i ran for some of the positions as well but didn't get to the final. I remained as a member and participated and did my part as a member of the program. I was published in the Jackets newspaper at my school in December 2021, I wrote a little about COVID and interviewed a few students. As a freshman in college now, I am involved in different activities. I am part of the Economics club, and the business strategy club. I'm also part of the East African club and I plan on running for a position in the club in my sophomore year. To improve the club and connect different cultures on campus with one another. I am also planning on creating my own club that is all about culture exchange since there are lots of different cultures here at UCR. Having a club that welcomes them all and gives every student the chance to learn more about their culture as well as another would be great. I also  participated in the Fall's IM seasons, played basketball. I played all quarters this year and will continue to play next year as well. <br><br>
